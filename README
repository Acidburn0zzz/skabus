skabus - a simpler Unix bus
---------------------------

 skabus is a suite of programs related to 1-to-many,
many-to-1 or many-to-many interprocess communication on Unix.
Ultimately, it will be a full implementation of a Unix bus,
aiming for simplicity and maintainability.

 For now, it is very much a work in progress, and it feels like
a random collection of tools, even if it's not random.

 See http://skarnet.org/software/skabus/ for details.
