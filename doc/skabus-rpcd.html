<h1> The <tt>skabus-rpcd</tt> program </h1>

<p>
<tt>skabus-rpcd</tt> is the serving part of the
<a href="skabus-rpc-daemon.html">skabus-rpc-daemon</a>
RPC mapper daemon.
It assumes that its stdin is a bound and listening Unix
domain socket;
it accepts connections from clients connecting to that socket,
and transmits messages between clients.
</p>

<h2> Overview and terminology </h2>

<ul>
 <li> Every program connecting to skabus-rpcd, for instance using the
<a href="libskabus/rpc.html">skabus_rpc library</a>, is called a
<em>client</em>. This is standard Unix client-server terminology. </li>
 <li> A client can have two functions:
  <ul>
   <li> It can implement and register an <em>interface</em>. </li>
   <li> It can perform <em>queries</em> to an <em>interface</em>
provided by another client. </li>
  </ul>
  A client can perform both functions. </li>
 <li> skabus-rpcd is the <em>RPC mapper</em>. It accepts interface
registrations, and client queries. It directs queries made to an
interface to the client that implements that interface, and directs
the <em>reply</em> to the client that made the query. </li>
 <li> A client making a query is called a <em>qclient</em>. A
client replying to a query is called a <em>rclient</em>. skabus-rpcd
tries to be as transparent and out-of-the-way as possible: all a qclient
is interested in is getting its query to the corresponding rclient, and
getting the reply from said rclient. skabus-rpcd's only job is to get
the queries and replies to the appropriate processes. </li>
</ul>


<h2> Interface </h2>

<pre>
     skabus-rpcd [ -1 ] [ -v verbosity ] [ -c <em>maxconn</em> ] [ -t <em>clienttimeout</em> ] [ -T <em>lameducktimeout</em> ] [ -i <em>rulesdir</em> | -x <em>rulesfile</em> ] [ -S | -s ] [ -J | -j ]
</pre>

<ul>
 <li> skabus-rpcd accepts connections from clients to an already
bound and listening SOCK_STREAM Unix domain socket which is its
standard input. </li>
 <li> It runs until it receives a SIGTERM, in which case it will
stop accepting new client operations, and exit 0 when the pending
operations have completed. </li>
 <li> Client connections last as long as the client wants to, unless an
error occurs, or unless the server is told to exit - in which cases
skabus-rpcd forcibly disconnects the client. </li>
 <li> Clients can perform operations by calling the appropriate
functions in the <a href="libskabus/rpc.html">skabus_rpc</a> library. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Operation </h2>

<ul>
 <li> A client <em>connects</em> to skabus-rpcd. </li>
 <li> A client <em>registers itself</em> to skabus-rpcd, giving it
the <em>identifier</em> it wishes to acquire. This identifier can
be any string, up to SKABUS_RPC_IDSTR_SIZE (254) characters.
Depending on skabus-rpcd's configuration, not every client is
allowed to use any string, see below. </li>
 <li> A client may <em>register interfaces</em>. For every
interface it wishes to register, it gives skabus-rpcd an
<em>interface name</em>, which is the name qclients will access
that interface under. It also provides an <em>interface body</em>,
which contains pointers to functions that will be called to serve
queries made to that interface. (The interface body is not sent to
skabus-rpcd: it's only relevant inside the rclient's address space.) </li>
 <li> A qclient can send <em>queries</em> to an interface. A query is
just an array of bytes, possibly coupled with an array of file
descriptors (if the qclient is authorized to send file descriptors).
skabus-rpcd routes the query to the rclient that has registered
the interface. </li>
 <li> The rclient receives the query, with a little additional
information from skabus-rpcd: a timestamp, the qclient's identifier,
the qclient's credentials. The appropriate callback declared in
the <em>interface body</em> is run, and the reply is sent to
skabus-rpcd, which routes it back to the qclient. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 skabus-rpcd only performs low-level operations and message routing.
Client identifiers, interface names and queries are strings or arrays
of bytes - they are not structured. It's up to the client programs
to decide on a structure for the queries, a protocol between qclient
and rclient.
</p>

<h2> Options </h2>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>-1</tt>&nbsp;: write a newline to stdout, and close stdout,
right before entering the client-accepting loop.
If stdout is suitably redirected, this can be used by monitoring
programs to check when the server is accepting connections. See
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6/notifywhenup.html">this page</a>
for more information on readiness notification. </li>
 <li> <tt>-v&nbsp;<em>verbosity</em></tt>&nbsp;: be more or less
verbose. <em>verbosity</em> can be 0 (quiet), 1 (normal), or 2 or more
(verbose). </li>
 <li> <tt>-c&nbsp;<em>maxconn</em></tt>&nbsp;: accept at most
<em>maxconn</em> concurrent connections. Default is 40. It is
impossible to set it higher than the value of the SKABUS_RPC_MAX macro,
i.e. 1000. </li>
 <li> <tt>-t&nbsp;<em>clienttimeout</em></tt>&nbsp;: disconnect a client
if it's in the middle of an operation and it has not written or read any
data in <em>clienttimeout</em> milliseconds. By default, <em>clienttimeout</em>
is 0, which means infinite. </li>
 <li> <tt>-T&nbsp;<em>lameducktimeout</em></tt>&nbsp;: give clients
<em>lameducktimeout</em> milliseconds to finish their current operations
before exiting after receiving a SIGTERM. By default, <em>lameducktimeout</em>
is 0, which means infinite. </li>
 <li> <tt>-x&nbsp;<em>rulesfile</em></tt>&nbsp;: read access rights
configuration from
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cdb_%28software%29">CDB</a>
file <em>rulesfile</em>. </li>
 <li> <tt>-i&nbsp;<em>rulesdir</em></tt>&nbsp;: read access rights
configuration from the filesystem in directory <em>rulesdir</em>. </li>
 <li> <tt>-S</tt>&nbsp;: no open registration. Clients that cannot find
a matching <tt>env/SKABUS_RPC_ID_REGEX</tt> entry in their accepted
ruleset are forbidden to register themselves. This is the default. </li>
 <li> <tt>-s</tt>&nbsp;: open registration. If the accepted ruleset
for the client does not contain a <tt>env/SKABUS_RPC_ID_REGEX</tt> entry,
the client is authorized to register itself with any identifier. </li>
 <li>  <tt>-J</tt>&nbsp;: no open interface registration. If the accepted
ruleset for the client does not contain a <tt>env/SKABUS_RPC_INTERFACES_REGEX</tt> entry,
the client will be unable to register interfaces. This is the default. </li>
 <li> <tt>-j</tt>&nbsp;: open interface registration. If the accepted ruleset
for the client does not contain a <tt>env/SKABUS_RPC_ID_REGEX</tt> entry,
the client is authorized to register interfaces with any name. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Signals </h2>

<ul>
 <li> SIGTERM: enter lameduck mode (stop accepting new clients and new
operations), then exit when no more operation is pending. </li>
 <li> SIGHUP: reopen <em>rulesfile</em>, if skabus-rpcd has been run
with the <tt>-x</tt> option. It is not necessary to send skabus-rpcd
a SIGHUP when the <tt>-i</tt> option is used instead: configuration
changes in the filesystem are automatically picked up. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Configuration </h2>
</a>

<p>
 Before running skabus-rpcd (or its wrapper
<a href="skabus-rpc-daemon.html">skabus-rpc-daemon</a>), it is necessary
to configure it. This is done by a series of rules, or <em>ruleset</em>,
stored in either a <em>rulesfile</em> in the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cdb_%28software%29">CDB</a> format,
or in a <em>rulesdir</em>, i.e. a directory in the filesystem following a
certain format. skabus-rpcd will refuse to run if neither the <tt>-i</tt>
nor the <tt>-x</tt> option has been provided.
</p>

<p>
 Rulesets can be converted between the <em>rulesdir</em> and
<em>rulesfile</em> formats with the
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-accessrules-cdb-from-fs.html">s6-accessrules-cdb-from-fs</a> and
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-accessrules-fs-from-cdb.html">s6-accessrules-fs-from-cdb</a>
conversion tools.
</p>

<h3> Rules format </h3>

<p>
 The rules file, or rules directory, follows the
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6/libs6/accessrules.html">s6 accessrules format</a>
for uid and gid checking. For every connecting client, skabus-rpcd matches the uid
and gid of the client against the provided ruleset, and determines what
the client is authorized to do.
</p>

<p>
 By default, no client is allowed to do anything - not even
connect to the server. Even <tt>root</tt>, the super-user, will be denied
access. That is why
it is essential to create a sensible ruleset prior to running the server
in order to do anything useful.
</p>

<p>
 Here is how to configure a rulesdir for a client running as uid <em>u</em>.
It is also possible to configure rules for clients running under gid
<em>g</em> by replacing <tt>uid/<em>u</em></tt> with <tt>gid/<em>g</em></tt>
il all the examples below. The default behaviour can be configured under
<tt>uid/default</tt>. It is also possible to use a rulesfile instead
by writing a rulesdir and converting it to a rulesfile with the
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-accessrules-cdb-from-fs.html">s6-accessrules-cdb-from-fs</a>
program.
</p>

<ul>
 <li> If the <tt>uid/<em>u</em>/allow</tt> file exists, the client will be
authorized to connect to the server. This is a prerequisite for
doing anything. </li>
 <li> The <tt>uid/<em>u</em>/env/SKABUS_RPC_ID_REGEX</tt> file
should contain a regular expression. The client will be authorized to
register itself using an identifier that matches that regular
expression. If the file does not exist, the default behaviour is
given by the <tt>-S</tt> or <tt>-s</tt> option to skabus-rpcd. </li>
 <li> The <tt>uid/<em>u</em>/env/SKABUS_RPC_INTERFACES_REGEX</tt> file
should contain a regular expression. The client will be authorized to
register interfaces with names that match that regular
expression. If the file does not exist, the default behaviour is
given by the <tt>-J</tt> or <tt>-j</tt> option to skabus-rpcd. </li>
 <li> If the <tt>uid/<em>u</em>/env/SKABUS_RPC_QSENDFDS</tt> file
exists <em>and is not empty</em>, the client will be allowed to send
queries containing open file descriptors. If the file exists and is
empty, the client will be explicitly denied this right: it will only
be allowed to send purely textual queries. </li>
 <li> If the <tt>uid/<em>u</em>/env/SKABUS_RPC_RSENDFDS</tt> file
exists <em>and is not empty</em>, the client will be allowed to send
replies containing open file descriptors to the queries it gets.
If the file exists and is
empty, the client will be explicitly denied this right: it will only
be allowed to reply with purely textual answers. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Notes </h2>

<ul>
 <li> skabus-rpcd is meant to be execve'd into by a program that gets
the listening socket. That program is normally
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-ipcserver-socketbinder.html">s6-ipcserver-socketbinder</a>,
which creates the socket itself; but it can be a different one if the
socket is to be obtained by another means, for instance if it has
been retrieved from a fd-holding daemon. </li>
</ul>
